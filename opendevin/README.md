# OpenDevin example

By default OpenDevin operates with the `sandbox` folder on this Devbox. If you want to try OpenDevin on one of your repositories, simply clone it on this Devbox and change the `WORKSPACE_PATH` in `start-devin.sh`.

Run the task `Start OpenDevin` and open the preview.

**NOTE!** We are running the bleeding edge version
